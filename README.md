I'm a full-stack engineer and technical lead with a strong product focus and over 6 years of experience delivering high-quality applications. I enjoy working closely with product specialists, designers and clients to construct polished, delightful experiences that provide meaningful value to users.

I'm passionate about the process of efficient software delivery, and am a passionate proponent of test driven development, clean code and continuous integration.
